If you'd like to just do Labs 1 through 5 with the robot arms, go to the tab called Arm Labs BOM to see what you need to purchase. Otherwise if you'd like to build the full Pupper robot, use the Pupper v2.1 BOM tab.

Overview
---------

The parts for Pupper v2.1 are sourced from four main vendors: Amazon, DJI, JLCPCB, and McMaster.

Ordering the parts from Amazon, DJI, and McMaster is very straightforward. However, the robot uses two custom PCBs which are slightly more complicated to order. The basic procedure is to upload our PCB files to JLCPCB, which will make the boards and assemble the components onto the boards for you. Detailed instructions are linked in the BOM.

The robot also uses many 3D printed parts, which we usually print ourselves on hobby FDM printers. Instructions are linked in the BOM.

Notes
--------
Sometimes the BMI160 IMU is out of stock. In that case, leave it off the bottom PCB and you can drop in a `ICM20649 <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4464>`_.
